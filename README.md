# Linked Lists

## Description

This application is an implementation of a linked list. A linked list is a data structure that stores each element in a special container (or node) that contains a link to the next element, or also to the previous element (in the case of a doubly linked list). The application allows you to read, write, delete elements, as well as clone a list, change the order of its elements and add elements of another collection to it.

## Variant Calculation

My grade book number is 1327.

1327 % 4 = 3, so my variant is 3.

I created two implementations:

- A list based on built-in arrays/lists
- A doubly linked list

## Conclusion

I have never been worked with unit tests, and it was my first experience with them. They helped me to solve problems with my code program. Early, I thought that they are too hard, but after this lab I recognised that they are easy to understand and useful.
